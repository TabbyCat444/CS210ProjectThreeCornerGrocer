# 7-3ProjectThreeCornerGrocery
CS210 final project

### Scenario:
You are doing a fantastic job at Chada Tech in your new role as a junior developer, and you <br>
exceeded expectations in your last assignment for Airgead Banking. Since your team is impressed <br>
with your work, they have given you another, more complex assignment. Your task is to build an <br>
item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested functionality.
<br><br>
The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. <br>
These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. <br>
They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so <br>
they can create the most effective layout for their customers.
<br><br>

## The program that the Corner Grocer is asking you to create should address the following functional requirements: <br>

### Menu Option One: <br>
Prompt a user to input the item, or word, they wish to look for. <br>
Return a numeric value for the frequency of the specific word.
<br><br>

### Menu Option Two: <br>
Print the list with numbers that represent the frequency of all items purchased. <br>
The screen output should include every item (represented by a word) paired with the number of <br>
times that item appears in the input file, CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt. For example, the file might read as follows: <br>
		Potatoes 4 <br>
		Pumpkins 5 <br>
		Onions 3
<br><br>

### Menu Option Three: <br>
Print the same frequency information for all the items in the form of a histogram. <br>
Then print the name, followed by asterisks or another special character to represent the numeric amount. <br>
The number of asterisks should equal the frequency read from the CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt file. <br>
For example, if the file includes 4 potatoes, 5 pumpkins, and 3 onions, then your text-based histogram may <br>
appear as represented below. However, you can alter the appearance or color of the histogram in any way you choose: <br>
		Potatoes **** <br>
		Pumpkins ***** <br>
		Onions *** <br>
<br><br>

### Menu Option Four: <br>
Exit the program.
<br><br>

### Data File Creation: <br>
Create a data file, with the naming convention frequency.dat, for backing up your accumulated data. <br>
The frequency.dat file should include every item (represented by a word) paired with the number of times <br>
that item appears in the input file.
